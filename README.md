# Image Processing Project
Let's understand the areas covered in this project!
## Overview

This project implements various image processing techniques using the Portable Gray Map (PGM) format in C++. It provides functionalities to manipulate grayscale images, including combining images, fading, rotation, filtering, resizing, and more.

## Features

- **Combine Images**: Merge two images side by side or top to bottom.
- **Fade In**: Gradually blend two images over a specified number of frames and seconds.
- **Rotate**: Rotate an image by a given angle around a specified point.
- **Negative**: Convert an image to its negative.
- **Flip**: Flip an image horizontally or vertically.
- **Change Brightness**: Adjust the brightness of an image.
- **Quantize**: Reduce the number of colors in an image.
- **Median Filter**: Apply a median filter to remove noise.
- **Mean Filter**: Apply a mean filter for smoothing.
- **Resize**: Change the size of an image either by specifying new dimensions or using a scaling ratio.
- **Transform**: Apply a geometric transformation matrix to an image.
- **Crop**: Crop an image to a specified rectangle.
- **Filter**: Apply a custom convolution filter to an image.
- **Derivative**: Compute the derivative image to detect edges.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`)
- Standard C++ Library

## Compilation

1. **To compile the project, use the following command:**
   ```bash
   g++ -o image_processor main.cpp

2. **Then run the executable:**
   ```bash
   ./image_processor

## Conclusion

I hope these tools and techniques enhance your understanding of image manipulation and inspire further experimentation. Happy coding!
